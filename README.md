# CAPE_Analysis

This is a project to model the relationship between Cyclically Adjusted Price to Earnings ratio and Long-term Interest Rates.

The Cyclically Adjusted Price to Earnings ratio is captured through an 10 year average P/E ratio that has been adjusted for inflation. Long-term interest rates are represented by yield on 10 year US. treasury.

The data can be downloaded via this [link](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data/ie_data.xls)
